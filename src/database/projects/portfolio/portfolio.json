    "value": "My goal was to build a simple, nice to look at, straight to the point, portfolio to showcase my skills in a short amount of time. To do that, I created wireframes and high-fidelity mock ups in Figma. I then did an estimate based on the designs which totalled 24 hours. I planned the database in Figma by mapping out the collections and schema. Finally, I made use of my Next.js Simple Boilerplate project and set out to build the app. All in all, it took me 26 hrs to build this. Getting the data together took a lot more time than I had expected. I'm quite proud of it. I hope you enjoyed my portfolio and if you have any feedback, please let me know via the contact form below.",
