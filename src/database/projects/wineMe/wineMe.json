WineMe helps us keep track of the wine farms we have visited and also to find new ones that we haven't. This app includes features such as featured wine farm, view a list of wine farms closest to you, keep track of wine farms you've visited by checking in search for wine farms by text, search for wine farms by area and help others by answering questions about a wine farm you've checked into. I also built a database for this app using the old Google Places radar search.","type":"string"},"shortDescription":{"value":"Keep track of the wine farms you've visited and find new ones that you haven't!","type":"string"}}
